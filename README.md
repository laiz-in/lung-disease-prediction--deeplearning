# lung-disease-prediction--deeplearning

we are using vgg16 architecture to predict the chances of pneumonia with an image of x ray

dataset link is given as a seperate file

no of training images - 3875 images of affected persons
                      - 1341 images of non-affected
                      
no of testing images - 234 images of affected persons
                      - 390 images of non-affected


no of validation images - 8 images of affected persons
                        - 8 images of non-affected
                        
           
AS THE DATASET IS STILL NOT ENOUGH , PREDICTIONS AND MODEL ARE USEFUL FOR STUDY PURPOSE ONLY!
